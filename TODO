- respect stringprep/nodeprep  -  jid validator

- i hate that xmlns's are as strings and never validated
  - could perhaps pass xmlns as last parameter to
    xml-element-to-event

- create a connect-test which makes a "fake" connection but
  still writes into a stream.  prerequisite for writing a test
  suite (which i should do).

- avent found a good use for IDs yet so right now they are
  just what happen to be in the specs
